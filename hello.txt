Hello, World!
I am so excited to be joining the Jupiter Cohort at Codeup!
During my time at Codeup I will be learning all about Full-Stack Web Development.
The Full-Stack Web Development program at Codeup includes: HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript, TDD, Web Design, jQuery, Java I, Java II, MySQL, Java III, Spring, and Capstone.
The program is approximately 22 weeks in length.
The program starts September 2020.
The program ends March 2021.
The program is currently taking place online via Zoom.
Attending Codeup is going to be a great experience! I look forward to all the learning and coding that will take place during my time at Codeup.
